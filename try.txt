    SYNOPSIS FOR DSA PROJECT

Project Title : grep command. MIS : 141808009
INTRODUCTION

‘grep’ searches input files for lines containing a match to a given pattern list. When it finds a match in a line, it copies the line to standard output (by default), or produces whatever other sort of output you have requested with options.

Though ‘grep’ expects to do the matching on text, it has no limits on input line length and it can match arbitrary characters within a line.
SYNTAX OF GREP

The general synopsis of the ‘grep’ command line is

grep [OPTIONS] PATTERN [FILE...]

    -b : Displays the byte offset of matched pattern in each line.
    -c : count the no. of matching lines.
    -v : displays all non-matching lines.
    -H : prints filename for each matched lines containing pattern.
    -h : Display matched lines, but don't display filenames.
